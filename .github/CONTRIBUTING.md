## Contributing to Luna

## Thank you for wanting to contribute! Here are some ground rules:

## How you can contribute:
1. **Report bugs** via GitHub Issues.
2. **Propose new features** (widgets, integrations).
3. **Submit Pull Requests (PRs)**:
- Use the `dev` branch for development.
- Respect the existing code style (use `go fmt`).
- Clearly describe what problem your PR solves.

## Development process:
- All changes must go through the `dev` branch.
- Official releases are made only from `main`.
